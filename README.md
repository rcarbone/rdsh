* Hello world!
  ============

  Hello world, I am rdsh, the Redis shell.

  So, is rdsh a shell? No, no!
  rdsh is a Redis client. No, no again!

  Ok, let me explain.

  rdsh is a hack of the tcsh, mainly implemented to add Redis client
  functionalities into a shell.

  rdsh is several things at the same time: a shell, a Redis client,
  a Redis terminal-based program to create/read/administer Redis
  databases in character based terminals and finally a rendering
  engine for Redis data structures.

  So rdsh is surely a shell, because all of the existing native tcsh
  functionalities are left unchanged.

  But rdsh is also a Redis client because it has builtin extensions
  that allow you to manage one or more Redis server at the same time.

  All in a single program without leaving your native job enviroment!

  Have fun!
