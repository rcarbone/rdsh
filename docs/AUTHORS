rdsh exists because I am a programmer and I am so lazy to set the PATH
enviroment variable to search for a suitable Redis client while doing
my daily job.

I would like to fill/query/display Redis data with only few statements
and none of the existent clients are programmable enough to match
my requirements.

Moreover I also am a pipe (|) fanatic, and, in the spirit of Unix,
I usually want to filter the output and pass it to subprograms.

None of the Redis clients I tried have the pipe (|) command implemented.

So, instead to reinvent the wheel, I just started to think to reuse the pipe
mechanism that all the Unix shells have already implemented.

So rdsh was born as an extension of the tcsh, which is my daily shell.
I started hacking the tcsh sources in order to add more builtins as
extensions for Redis servers.
