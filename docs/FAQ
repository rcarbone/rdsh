F A Q:
======

Q. Why did you implemented rdsh?
A. Because of my own personal needs!


Q. What can rdsh do for me?
A. rdsh is a both a shell and a Redis client.


Q. Why I should use this software?
A. So, if you are interestered in Redis data structures,
   please give rdsh a chance to run on your host.
   It aims to be in a near future a modern solution as
   Redis client for character-based terminals.


Q. Why does rdsh use the hiredis library included in Redis?
A. It was the choice by default because hiredis it widely
   used in different contexts by several people and
   organizations and maintained by the same author of Redis.


Q. Had rdsh been ported over other shells?
A. No.
   But I planned to have rdsh as an extension of the GNU bash


Q. Can I know the list of OSs and supported platforms rdsh run on?
A. I wrote and tested the shell on my Intel x86_64 box running
    Debian/Linux (the glorious Intel NUC) with the GNU C compiler.
   I think it should be ported with minimal effort on any Posix
   compliant System.

   Microsoft Windows? oh no, again! please don't ask.


Q. Where can I get the latest version of rdsh?
A. You can download it from github at:
     https://github.com/rcarbone/rdsh


Q. Where can I get more information on rdsh?
A. There is not an official home page for rdsh (yet).


Q. Are there any mailing list dedicated to rdsh?
A. No! for the time being.


Q. If I need support can I contact you?
A. Yes, but I am so busy. So send me a mail and please be patient!
