Writing Extensions
==================

This section explains how to add a new built-in to the Redis shell.

As I said in the README, the Redis shell is easily extendible.
At the time of writing, I had already implemented about 132 new builtins.

The simplest possible extension to the Redis shell can be found
in src/extensions/stupid.c in the source distribution, which can be used
both as template and also as an valuable tutorial for the beginners.

Suppose now you want to add a new function to the already available
extensions of the Redis shell.  Here are the istructions to proceed.

1. cp the source file src/extensions/stupid.c in src/extensions/foo.c
   and edit the copy to meet your requirements.

   Choose the name you want to assign to the new builtin extension
   and assign the name to the function
   e.g.
     int rdsh_foo (int argc, char * argv []) { ... }

2. edit the src/extensions/Makefile to add foo.c to the list of known
   sources to be compiled.

   In fact this Makefile can be used only with development goals
   in mind, just to allow on-place compilation and before
   the extension has to be definitely inserted into the rdsh.

4. Add a numeric id CMD_FOO in rdsh.h (section: GNU short options)

5. Add command CMD_FOO in help.c (section: static builtin_t commands [])

6. edit 'configure' at the top level

   a. add the source file foo.c to the shell variable $FILES

   b. add a branch [case] needed to patch sh.init.c in subroutine
      linenumber() near the begin of the configure file.

      Example: if the name you have assigned to the new extension
                is "foo" then it _must_ be placed before the already
                exiting command "foreach", and therefore you have to
                add a line in the switch section of the linenumeber()
                subroutine of configure which looks like this:

                foo)     before=foreach     ;;

      Warning: Please note that alphabetic order in this table is vital.
               You will miss the extension if you insert the entry in a
               wrong place!  This is currently tcsh limitation for unknown reasons.

      You have be warned!!!

That's all folks!
