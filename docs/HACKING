How to add an new builtin for rdsh.
===================================

Suppose you want to add a new function to the already avaialable extensions for rdsh.
Here are the istructions to proceed.

1. Edit the extensions/help.c in order to add an item to the table
   of builtins known by the shell

2. Add the extension with its own unique [name] in a file
   under the extensions/ directory

   /* tcsh builtin extension [name] */
   int rdsh_name (int argc, char * argv [])
   {
     return rdsh_command (argc, argv);
   }

3. Edit the configure shell script and add there a new line
   to the list of EXTRACMDS containing the [name] for the builtin

4. Edit the configure shell script and add there a new line
   to the switch in function linenumber()

   Please follow the rules already implemented because
   the alphabetic order is vital.

   You will miss the extension if you insert an entry in a wrong place!
   You have be warned.


have fun!
